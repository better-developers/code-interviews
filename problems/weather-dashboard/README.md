# Local Weather Dashboard

### Background:

We, at Better Developers, love to be prepared. However, we're tired of unexpected downpours and arriving at the office soaking wet. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to help us get ahead of the weather.

### Task:

Create a dashboard that displays the current weather as well as future forecasts for our office location, ensuring we’re never caught off guard. You can use any publicly available API for fetching the weather data, or if you want, you can generate your own dummy data.

### Specifications:

1. Location Details:

   - Latitude: 56.1518
   - Longitude: 10.2064
   - Address: Rosenkrantzgade 19B, 8000 Aarhus C

2. Output:

   - Current weather (e.g., temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed).
   - Forecast for the next 7 days.

3. Interface:
   - You have full creative freedom here! We’re open to seeing solutions ranging from a terminal interface, web applications, APIs or maybe even an AI application! We'd love to see what you can think to show us.

### Tips:

- Don't get caught up in the details. We look at the overall solution, and notice anything from core functionality to architecture and user experience.
- Think about what you want to show us. If you get stuck, it's perfectly fine to write some pseudo-code!
- We love to see a well-documented solution with comments explaining the rationale behind decisions made.

### Submission:

Please send your solution, along with any documentation or instructions needed to understand, run, and test your code.

Have fun!
